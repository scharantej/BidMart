**Problem Analysis:**

The problem calls for developing a website using Flask to facilitate the sale of commodities with distinct seller and user profiles and enable live bidding.

**Flask Application Design:**

**HTML Files:**

* **index.html:** The landing page of the website, featuring a login or registration form for users and sellers.
* **seller_dashboard.html:** A dashboard for sellers to manage their listed commodities, create new listings, and monitor bids.
* **user_dashboard.html:** A dashboard for users to browse commodities, place bids, and track their purchases.
* **bidding_page.html:** A dedicated page for users to place bids on specific commodities in an auction-style format.

**Routes:**

* **@app.route('/')**: The default route, rendering the index.html page.
* **@app.route('/login', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Handles user and seller login.
* **@app.route('/register', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Handles user and seller registration.
* **@app.route('/seller_dashboard')**: Renders the seller_dashboard.html page.
* **@app.route('/user_dashboard')**: Renders the user_dashboard.html page.
* **@app.route('/list_commodity', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Allows sellers to create new commodity listings.
* **@app.route('/browse_commodities')**: Fetches and displays a list of available commodities for users.
* **@app.route('/bidding_page/<commodity_id>')**: Renders the bidding_page.html view for a specific commodity, enabling users to place bids.
* **@app.route('/place_bid', methods=['POST'])**: Processes and stores user bids.
* **@app.route('/manage_bids', methods=['GET', 'POST'])**: Provides sellers with functionality to manage received bids.
